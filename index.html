    <b><h1>Quick Hummus Recipe</h1></b>
    <span style="text-indent: 30px;"><p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of 
different recipes that I have read over the years.</p></span> <br> 

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>• 1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</ul>
    <ul>• 175g of tahini</ul>
    <ul>• 6 sundried tomatoes</ul>
    <ul>• Half a red pepper</ul>
    <ul>• A pinch of cayenne pepper</ul>
    <ul>• 1 clove of garlic</ul>
    <ul>• A dash of olive oil</ul> <br>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>1. Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</ol>
    <ol>2. Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</ol>
    <ol>3. Add all the ingredients into a food processor</ol>
    <ol>4. Process all the ingredients into a paste</ol>
    <ol>5. If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</ol>
    <ol>6. If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</ol>

    <em><b>*</b>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, 
lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.<b>*</b></em> <br>

    <h4>Storage</h4>
    <ul>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. 
If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</ul> <br>
    <ul>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</ul> <br>
